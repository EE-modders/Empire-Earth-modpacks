- The f117 model isn't an f117 anymore, but instead an sr71 blackbird (should be black, but the original texture i used is white)

- The barracks 08 was made better by Philla, so it's only half my work 

- New tanks and pillbox haven't attack effects

- No shadows redone

- Some of those are from ee2 mods, so that's not for an official mod as now
